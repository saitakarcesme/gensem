# Preview — Sprint {sprint}

> Visual / structural preview produced before code. For `preview_variant: static`,
> contains wireframes, ASCII diagrams, and user-story walkthroughs. For
> `preview_variant: scaffold`, points to the runnable minimal scaffold at
> `scaffold_path` and captures its `PREVIEW:` placeholder markers.

## Preview Variant

- **Variant:** {static | scaffold}
- **Rationale:** {why this variant for this sprint — domain, tooling, throwaway-vs-continuity}
- **Scaffold path:** {path if scaffold; empty if static}

## UI Previews

_Wireframes or scaffold component references for UI-bearing TASKs._

### TASK-{ID} — {short title}

```
{ASCII wireframe or scaffold component path}
```

Interactions:
- {interaction 1}
- {interaction 2}

Responsive: {if applicable}

## API Previews

_Request/response examples for API-bearing TASKs._

### TASK-{ID} — {endpoint or operation name}

```
{HTTP method} {path}
Headers:
  {relevant headers}

Request:
  {body or params}

Response (200):
  {body}

Errors:
  - {error case 1}
  - {error case 2}
```

## Architecture Previews

_Component diagrams or dataflow sketches for architecture-shaping TASKs._

## Data Previews

_Sample records, schema snippets, entity relationships for data-bearing TASKs._

## Feature Walkthroughs

_Step-by-step user-perspective scenarios covering end-to-end usage._

## Import Previews

_If importing external sources: list of imported items with sanity checks._

## Inform-tier Decisions

> Low-risk autonomous decisions made during preview (Step 4 closure).
> Each was individually below the Gate threshold (P7). Reviewed as a batch
> at activity closure — the user can promote any to a Gate decision.

- _{decision 1}_
- _{decision 2}_

_A `## UX Notes` section is appended on demand by `/gse:preview` Step 2.5 — UX design pass (LOW findings); no empty placeholder heading is pre-created._
