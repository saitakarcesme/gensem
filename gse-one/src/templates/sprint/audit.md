# Methodology Audit — {YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm}

**Sprint:** {sprint}  
**Trigger:** {manual | auto-trigger | scheduled}  
**Audit engine:** project-audit {audit_version}  
**Phase:** {Phase 1 deterministic | Phase 1 + Phase 2 hybrid}

## Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| CRITICAL |       |
| HIGH     |       |
| MEDIUM   |       |
| LOW      |       |
| **Total**|       |

_CRITICAL is reserved for P15 escalation cases (e.g., silently corrupted state file, diverging git history). Baseline severity for drift detection: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW._

## Deterministic findings (Phase 1)

_Findings emitted by `plugin/tools/project-audit.py`. Each follows the canonical format `AUD-NNN [SEVERITY] — title` per design §3.4 Dashboard parser format contracts._

### CRITICAL

_(none)_

### HIGH

_(none)_

### MEDIUM

_(none)_

### LOW

_(none)_

## Semantic findings (Phase 2 — deferred)

_When Phase 2 ships, findings from the `project-reviewer` sub-agent will appear here. These cover semantic drift (P9 jargon in beginner output, P14 learning sessions not delivered, REQ/DESIGN coherence gaps, etc.) that deterministic checks cannot catch._

In Phase 1, this section is intentionally empty; the Inform note in the activity log records the deferral.

## Actions taken

_Corrections applied during this audit (see activity Step 5)._

| Finding | Severity | Action | Outcome | DEC ref |
|---------|----------|--------|---------|---------|
|         |          |        |         |         |

## Deferred findings

_Findings not acted on during this audit. Persist for the next `/gse:audit` invocation._

| Finding | Severity | Reason deferred |
|---------|----------|-----------------|
|         |          |                 |

## Notes

_Audit-level observations, patterns, recommendations for next sprint or for /gse:compound Axe 3 integration._
